WE NEED YOUR HELP to bring our newest project to fruition
Massage training centre for Blind girls and women
Hand Back Health is piloting an economic empowerment project to skill young adult females with visual impairment in professional massage therapy rendering them highly employable and leading to economic independence. 
The project will focus on young adult women with visual impairment due to the inherent difficulties for this portion of the population to gain employment. A person with a disability is almost twice as likely to be unemployed and women are at an even greater disadvantage. This pilot project aims to increase employment opportunities for visually impaired women by providing vocational training in a skill that is applicable to their disability, provides a multitude of employment and self-employed possibilities whilst also providing a community wellness service need.
