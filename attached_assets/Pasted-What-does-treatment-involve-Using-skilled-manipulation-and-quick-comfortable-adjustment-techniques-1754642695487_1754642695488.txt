What does treatment involve?
Using skilled manipulation and quick, comfortable adjustment techniques, with just the right amount of pressure, Chiropractors gently unlock the stiff joints to restore proper function and mobility. This in turn helps to settle the pain. The vulnerable area is then stabilised with further treatments. When you have experienced the benefits of chiropractic treatment in reducing pain and discomfort, the next step is to help you get active again. Following treatment rehabilitation and exercise are essential to speed your body’s natural healing process and strengthen your muscles to prevent recurrence of the condition. 

Alongside the traditional chiropractic adjustment, chiropractors utilize adjunctive therapies:
Spinal and peripheral joint mobilization
Muscle, nerve and fascia release techniques 
Therapeutic instrument techniques and modalities
Exercise, rehabilitative programs and other forms of active care;
Nutrition and dietary interventions,
Psychosocial aspects of patient management;
Patient education on spinal health, posture, ergonomics, nutrition and other lifestyle modifications;
Emergency treatment and acute pain management procedures as indicated;
Other supportive measures, which may include the use of taping, back supports and orthotics;
Recognition of contraindications and risk management procedures, the limitations of chiropractic care, and of the need for protocols relating to referral to other health professionals.
