                      Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) is a safe and non-invasive technique that works by eliciting a biological tissue and cellular response that repairs the body naturally. PEMF uses Pulsating magnetic fields generated by electromagnets with particular frequencies, waveforms and intensities using specially designed apparatus for therapeutic, rejuvenative or performance enhancement benefits.
                    </p>

                      It improves blood supply and causes an increase in oxygen pressure, activating and regenerating cells.

                    <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                      This treatment concept is far from new; Academic study of PEMF began as early as 1932 when researchers from Yale University discovered that depleted electrical energy from the body caused dis-ease. However, pulsed electromagnetic fields were able to donate energy, helping cells to repair, rebuild, and regenerate naturally.

                      Scientists have observed that a healthy cell has a higher electrical charge than an unhealthy one. This higher charge permits it to function optimally. It has been established that tissues including blood, muscle, ligaments, bone and cartilage and nerves all respond to these biomagnetic fields.

                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  Chiropractic specialises in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of conditions which are due to mechanical dysfunction of the muscles, joints and in particular the spine and their effects upon the nervous system.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">What do Chiropractors do?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  In Chiropractic, the emphasis is on prevention and 'adjustment'. According to the condition being treated, one or more of a whole range of different chiropractic adjusting techniques can be used. With these your chiropractor effects an improvement in your joint's mobility, as well as nerve and muscle function. Your body's own healing process (which we normally recognise in its ability to heal bruises, cuts and broken bones) will then be able to continue the task of restoring normal function.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">What will happen when you visit a chiropractor?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                  A visit to the chiropractor is very similar to visiting your medical doctor; he or she is a primary healthcare professional. The difference is that the process and treatment of your complaint is always done from a holistic, drug free perspective. On the first visit the chiropractor will take your medical history carry out a full examination. This includes orthopaedic and neurological tests whereby muscle strength, nerve function, joint function, as well as body balance and alignment are assessed.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4">What does treatment involve?</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Using skilled manipulation and quick, comfortable adjustment techniques, with just the right amount of pressure, Chiropractors gently unlock the stiff joints to restore proper function and mobility. This in turn helps to settle the pain. The vulnerable area is then stabilised with further treatments. When you have experienced the benefits of chiropractic treatment in reducing pain and discomfort, the next step is to help you get active again. Following treatment rehabilitation and exercise are essential to speed your body's natural healing process and strengthen your muscles to prevent recurrence of the condition.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-600 font-semibold mb-3">Alongside the traditional chiropractic adjustment, chiropractors utilize adjunctive therapies:</p>
