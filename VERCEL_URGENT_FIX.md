# URGENT: Vercel Configuration Fix Required

## Issue Identified
Your vercel.json was simplified and missing critical serverless function configuration. This is why you're still getting "NOT_FOUND" errors.

## Required Fix - Update vercel.json immediately:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "functions": {
    "api/index.js": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/api/(.*)",
      "dest": "/api/index.js"
    },
    {
      "handle": "filesystem"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/dist/public/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "buildCommand": "npm run build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public"
}
```

## Status Verification
- ✅ Local API: Working perfectly (tested successfully)
- ✅ api/index.js: Correct serverless handler
- ❌ vercel.json: Missing function configuration (CRITICAL)
- ✅ Build process: Generating correct files

## Action Required
1. Replace vercel.json with the complete configuration above
2. Push to GitHub to trigger new Vercel deployment
3. The API endpoints will then route correctly through serverless functions

The booking functionality will work once vercel.json is properly configured.
